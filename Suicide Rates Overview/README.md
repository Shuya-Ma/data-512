# 512 Final Project

## Abstract

The goal of this project is to analyze the differences of suicide rate among countries, gender groups and age groups, as well as to figure out if there are any factors that may be correlated with the suicide rate.


## Data

The dataset used in this project is suicide rates overview 1985 to 2016 from Kaggle, which can be downloaded [here](https://www.kaggle.com/russellyates88/suicide-rates-overview-1985-to-2016) or can be found in the [data](https://github.com/Shuya-Ma/data-512/tree/main/Suicide%20Rates%20Overview/data) folder. The dataset contains incomplete data for year 2016 , so I exclude that year from my study.

The descriptions of column variables are listed below:
- Country 
- Year : 1985 - 2016
- sex : Male/Female
- age : age group (5-14, 15-24, 25-34, 35-54, 55-74, 75+)
- suicides_no : Number of suicides
- population : Number of all living people
- suicides/100k pop : suicide rate (per 100k population)
- country-year : country-year composite key
- HDI for year : Human development index of each country at given year
- gdp_for_year : GDP of each country at given year
- gdp_per_capita : GDP per capita of each country at given year
