One of my concerns would be that since the suicide rate dataset only has annual data, it might be hard to find correlations with other factors and there might also be some potential difficulties joining the factor datasets with the suicide data. Also, some of the suicide data are missing for certrain years. Therefore, it might also be impossible to show a clear trend of the suicide rate for some countries."

To better understand the relationship between suicide rate and other critical features mentioned above, I will probably apply linear regression model on the selected data."
